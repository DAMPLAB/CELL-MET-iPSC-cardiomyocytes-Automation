# CELL-MET-iPSC-cardiomyocytes-Automation

OT-2 API V2 protocol scripts for Opentrons robot with material for using OT-2 liquid handler to perform iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes culturing and differentiation.

This workflow enables iPSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes via Wnt signaling pathway using the OT2 liquid handling robot by Opentrons. This includes:
- Accutase splitting and seeding of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
- Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiation into cardiomyocytes (CMs) via Wnt signaling pathway
- Re-plating cardiomyocytes (CMs) onto fibronectin coating plate
